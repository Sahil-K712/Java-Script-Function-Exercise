I have created this repo because i wanted to add some JS function exercise.

This repository contains solutions for various JavaScript exercises, including:

- Squaring numbers in an array
- Filtering even numbers
- Summing numbers using reduce
- Filtering, squaring, and summing even numbers

- and one more file that has callback function.
